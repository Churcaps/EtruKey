## FAQ

#### Does the app contain a virus or trojan?

No, it doesn't. The app uses AutoHotkey (AHK) to detect key presses and replace them with the appropriate Etruscan characters. This method is safe and commonly used for keyboard scripting. I am working on it to remove the false-positive to anti-virus
